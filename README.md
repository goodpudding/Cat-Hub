## About The Project 🎯

The Cat Hub is a React-based web application designed to help users find the perfect cat for adoption. It offers a scoring system that ranks different cat breeds based on various factors like temperament, affection level, and intelligence.

## Features

- Displays a list of cat breeds with relevant information
- Calculates an 'Adoption Score' based on affection level, intelligence, and temperament
- Fetches real-time images for each cat breed
- Provides additional details like life span, origin, and affection level for each cat breed

## Usage 🌈

To see details about each cat breed, simply click on the "View More" button on each cat card. You'll be able to see details like life span, origin, and a calculated adoption score.
